My name is Chenghao Wu (吴正浩). I am currently pursuing my PhD degree in the Mueller-Plathe group at TU-Darmstadt, Germany.

Places where I am living and lived
======
I lived in Suzhou for 22 years and then moved to Akron, where I obtained my Master degree. In Summer of 2018, I started my PhD life in Darmstadt, Germany.
